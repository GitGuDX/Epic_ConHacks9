## Inspiration
Games like Hotline Miami and Enter the Dungeon, where movement is fluid and exciting, and the ammo system had a bit more complexity because you have to manage your ammo. The different weapon's also had more novelty and content to the games.
## What it does
A top-down 3d shooter where you can jump in a lobby with your friends and start shooting at each other! You can dodge, run around and grab different weapons in a detailed 3d environment.
## How we built it
We used Unity framework and C# scripting. We chose Fusion, a networking library for unity to create the matchmaking component to the game.
## Challenges we ran into
We made games in Unity before but never with a multiplayer component to them. Understanding networking and implementing it into our project was one of our biggest challenges.
There were many conflicts when merging our scenes and scripts together on Github that had to be resolved.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implementing a working and technically impressive multiplayer feature, with a solid latency.
Creating the weapon system, with different guns, the ability to grab them inside the level and attaching them to the ammo system.

## What we learned
The concepts behind networking and game lobbies, and how to implement them in unity.


## What's next for Gunfight -Beenox Challenge 

We would like to test the gameplay more and work on making more complete features that the ones that are present, we tried to make it each good enough for a prototype so everything could not be optimized and there's al lot that could be improved or added to create a meaningful experience for the player.
